                    <h3>You must be kidding!! There are stars above E14?</h3>
                    <p>It was Halloween 2014, and I had recently bought my first Goto telescope1. The skies were clear that evening and thinking it might be a good idea to do a small public outreach, I had set it up at the riverside. The moon had not yet risen so all that was visible in our wonderful skies was a sprinkling of bright stars.
                    Not long after I had setup, a group of kids came and asked me what I was doing. I told them I was looking at the stars above and that they were welcome to have a look if they want. One of the kids thought I was tricking them and said ‘You must be kidding!! There are stars above E14?’ I said yes and I was not tricking. He came to the eyepiece and looked through it. I had focused my scope at the double cluster, an exceptional cluster of stars in the constellation of Cassiopeia. There was a wow and then another and then again. The kid could not believe what he was looking at was real.

                    <h3>Using Firecapture to eliminate Newton's Rings</h3>
                    <p>One of the main issues that you will almost certainly face while doing Ha imaging is Newton's rings. You can click the link to understand the physics behind this in detail, but essentially, in extreme narrowband imaging, if the optical axis of your setup is not completely straight and in line, you get a rippling interference pattern in your image, which can be annoying.</p>

                    <h3>Choosing accessories for your Lunt 35</h3>
                    <p>When you buy a scope, the inevitable second step is choosing the accessories. Wrong accessories don't just cause you to lose money, they cost wasted sessions, which in my opinion is a greater loss. So here's a brief summary of the accessories you may need for your Lunt 35. Not that you need all of them, you may require them for making the most out of your scope.</p>
